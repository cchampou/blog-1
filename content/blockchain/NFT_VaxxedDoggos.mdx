# Joma launches his own NFTs

https://twitter.com/VaxxedDoggos/status/1487442122252992516


[JomaTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKO9UjSeLew) aka Joma/Jonathan Ma is a fairly well-known YouTuber who brought
YouTube tech videos to another whole creative level.
He worked at Google, Facebook and BuzzFeed and is known for his satirical videos about
life in tech (Data Science), his big love for Black Pink, filmmaking and huge collection of stuffed Doggos (Shiba & Doge).

Right now Joma reached around [1.56M](https://www.youtube.com/c/jomaoppa) subscribers on Youtube and recently announced his first NFT collection: [VaxxedDoggos](https://www.vaxxeddoggos.com).
and I believe those doggos will be a very interesting and promising project in the content creator and blockchain space.

**NFT project details**
- VaxxedDoggos 2500 half corgis/shibas drawn by Joma
- should act as a funding for Joma's short films and content creation about crypto/blockchain on YT
- Solana Blockchain, minting price 0.88 SOL (~$100)
- public sale with Whitelist (1000)
- [whitepaper available](https://vaxxed-doggo-assets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Vaxxed+Doggos+Whitepaper.pdf)

Joma is one of the most creative and hard-working tech content-creators I follow and I think he will come up with some cool perks and privileges for the holders, especially content creators.
So I am convinced if we get our hands on those NFTs now, they could increase in value a lot in the future.

# **What makes this project promising?**

I believe Joma will be one of the first successful and serious tech content creator who is creating his own non-simping NFT collection with a clear goal and vision:
> **building the ["Joma Media Lab"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9JFitrgGgs&t=354s) and funding his film directing.**

I genuinely believe someone who worked at FANG companies always comes with a high level of execution, discipline and desire pursuing and fulfilling their dreams.
After watching Joma's videos for more than 2 years already I could follow his journey and development from a  data scientist to a software engineer, entertainer and most importantly as a film maker.


And after all those endless hours watching his videos, I can tell he never stopped evolving - just like Son-Goku. Every new video feels like another power level regarding creativity and his understanding for his viewership and YT-algorithm.
Working as a Data Scientist and Analyst comes with some useful skills I would say - as you can see the success in the graph down below.

When you think he couldn't do it better, he hires a whole movie making team and creates his own little [short movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZcmboYbNPQ&t=1s) in the Joma Universe.

# Key factors for the VaxxedDoggos
Putting his consistency and creativity as a content creator, ambitions and expertise as a software engineer and analytical competence as a data scientist recognizing the economical patterns between supply and demand of the tech space and his clear vision and roadmap behind the NFT collection - I am quite intrigued to say
that this project will be an exciting, promosing journey and will open up a lot of possibilities in the NFT space and for content creators themselves like myself.

Since Joma will be the essential foundation and main factor controlling the quality, branding and literally marketing of those digital assets (NFTs) himself, the values of the NFTs will change (de-/increase) depending on what Joma achieves himself.
That's what I believe in though. That's why I love content creation so much. You are in control of what, how and when - your whole reputation and personal branding as a content creator.
I am convinced that the value of the NFTs will proportionally grow with Joma's networth iself. And guess what? Joma quit his job as Google to become a full time content creator (probably) or..a crypto millionaire, we will see.

Joma cares for his subscribers very much and most importantly knows how to offer them value through his videos. In response to that
his audience wants to support and help Joma continuing creating educational videos about crypto and blockchain by joining and promoting his NFTs.
It will end up in a upward spiral.

Another and even more important message is that Joma joined the Bored Ape Yacht Club. One of the most popular NFT collections in the world with the highest Floor Price to date: 100 ETH (29.01.2022).

Right now there still are 425 Whitelist spots free until 1st February and Joma is hosting a lot of Whitelist spot giveaways on Twitter (https://twitter.com/vaxxeddoggos)

I believe the collection will be a really interesting asset, because the one parameter, which will create more momentum, reach or hype for this NFT collection is Joma himself. He already made his point by getting a BAYC member which simply says: "I am serious about the NFT space, I want to create something, I want a network full of like-minded people and build stuff together or just stay open for opportunities".
